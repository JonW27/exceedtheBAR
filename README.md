# exceedtheBAR

An antiprocrastination app. To build, clone this repo, fix the error I made in my package.json by changinng version to 1.1.0 and then run <code>$ npm install && npm start</code><br><br>

Since this is still in dev and this in alpha (no css styling, dev tools still opened,etc) the project will undergo rapid changes.
Binaries AS OF THIS DATE 4/2/16 are available at the following page <a href="#">not created yet</a>.
